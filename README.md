# nxbrowse

Browser for the NX (PKG4) game file format. Still under active development.


## Installation

To build from source you will need to install 
[pkgnx](https://github.com/aaronweiss74/pkgnx) to your local maven repository as
it is not available in maven central. Then run [leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) 
with the command `lein uberjar` in the main directory.

A standalone binary jar will be included in the download section.
